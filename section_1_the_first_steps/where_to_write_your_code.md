# Where to Write Your Code {#where-to-write-your-code}

Sadly, code can not be written in a Microsoft Word document. Well… I guess it can, but if you do, the full force of Reddit will come personally to your house and put you out of your misery.

You could write your code in a text editor or in an integrated developer environment \(IDE\). While a text editor offers some useful tools like syntax highlighting and automatic indentation, an IDE typically has a lot more features \(including really good tools to help you find errors in your code\). Some languages actually force you to stick to their integrated developer environment \(like MATLAB or Swift\).

## Text Editors {#text-editors}

When you just get started, you want to go straight to the code, without spending hours configuring your environment. A text editor that is easy to use, but that can be customized with excellent tools is perfect in these cases.

Notepad++ is great for quickly write your code down. It doesn’t take more than 5 minutes to install, it can be used with many different languages, and contains all you need to comfortably write your programs. However, unlike more advanced editors, you can’t run your code directly from Notepad++, so you will need to run it from the command line. However, there are ways to do so \(Stackoverflow example: [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1702586/how-to-execute-a-python-file-in-notepad)\), but it’s very clunky.

Atom and Sublime are the solution to this problem. After you install them, you can start coding straight away. However, as you develop, you might find yourself in need of some plugins to improve your productivity. They are easy to understand and install, and are completely free. There are many differences between Atom and Sublime, but starting with either is fine. Atom has a “Get Started” section on their website, whereas guides and tutorial for Sublime can be easily found [here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/text-editor). [Here's](https://medium.com/@faridlab/comparing-atom-sublime-text-f12470658fc7) a detailed side-by-side comparison of the two editors.

## Integrated Developer Environments {#integrated-developer-environments}

Once you have a reached a certain level in developing programs and software, you might want to upgrade to an integrated developer environment \(IDE\). IDEs typically have features that will help you develop back-end servers, Android apps, and use SQL queries and data visualisation more easily.

The JetBrains include IDEs for professional or advanced programmers, and cover many different languages \(including Java, C/C++, Python\). JetBrains normally requires you to pay for to access all the features of the IDEs. However, if you are a student, you will be able to access them for free, as part of their education initiative [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).
