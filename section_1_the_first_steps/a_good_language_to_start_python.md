## Python: A Good Language to Start {#a-good-language-to-start-python}

The Python 3 programming language is currently one of the most popular language in the scientific world; it is used in chemistry, physics, biostatistics, etc. It is also used by many programmers working with machine learning and web development. If you are looking to make a miscellaneous program on your computer Python is for you.

Because of its simplicity, it is also a really good language for beginners. Many schools have started adopting it as a language of choice for introductory courses, including MIT.

To install Python, you have to go on their website and [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the **3.6.4** version. Alternative, you can choose to learn Python 2.7, but most have moved on to the 3.6 version, and support and development for 2.7 has been stopped for a while.

If you want to learn as much Python as possible before the event start, reading the Think Python 2nd edition [book](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) will give you a very thorough rundown of the language. Read it carefully and do the exercises, and you should be more than ready for the hackathon!

On the day of the event, there are many resources available to quickly get started with Python. For beginners, going through the Codeacademy tutorial is a good start. If you already know a language or two, you can start by trying to automate repetitive tasks with [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). The Official Python [Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) also contains a detailed description of all the functions available in the language.
