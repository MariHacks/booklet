## GitHub: Collaborating and Sharing Code {#collaborating-and-sharing-code-with-github}

If you are working as a team then you really should use Github!

GitHub is one of the most important tool for sharing code to the general public, and collaborating with your friends on programming projects. Either you use it as a public dropbox, or as a tool for an advanced Software Development project, GitHub offers a range of functions that will make your life easier.

To get started you and all your friends will need to make yourselves a GitHub account. Then one of you will need to create a new repository \(the GitHub term for project or constellation of files\).

This is done by clicking on the little plus button in the top right and then clicking on “New repository”.

Give it a name and a description and then click create! \(note that the readme file is recommended so people who stumble upon your work will know what you have achieved\)

The next step is to allow your friends to contribute to your repository:

This is done by then clicking on the “Settings” tab in the bar just above the repository name. Then clicking on “Collaborators” in the menu on the left hand side and finally inviting your friends by writing their GitHub name in the search bar and clicking invite.

Now you need to install [GitHub for desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

You can enter your credentials and login.

On the repository page on your browser you can click on on the big green “clone or download” button and click on “open in desktop”

Now the repository should appear in GitHub for desktop and you will be able to click the “fetch” and then “pull” button to get up to date. Next you can click on the little blue text in the center to open the repository in explorer.

Now all changes made in this folder will be tracked and saved on GitHub even if multiple people are working at the same time. In fact to save your changes you have to “commit” them by adding a name to the changes and then clicking “fetch” or “push” or “pull” \(its all the same button!\)
