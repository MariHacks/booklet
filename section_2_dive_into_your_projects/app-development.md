# App Development

There are many ways to approach developing an app. Normally, apps would have to be developed for each platform \(i.e. Android, iOS\) individually. However, numerous frameworks exist that allow for writing code once and running it on both platform. Here, we focus on such cross-platform frameworks.

## Flutter

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a new framework for writing fast, beautiful apps for both iOS and Android. Set up flutter and start developing apps, follow their ["Get Started"](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guide.

## React Native

If you have experience with JavaScript and React, then you might prefer using React Native. See their ["Getting Started"](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide.
