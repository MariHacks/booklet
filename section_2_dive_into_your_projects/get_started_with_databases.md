## Get Started with Databases {#get-started-with-databases}

Most beginner projects will not require the use of a database as all pertinent information can be stored locally. However if you are looking to gather large amount of information and process it, a database will be integral. In fact a database is simply defined as a structured set of data that is stored on a computer and accessible in several different ways (i.e. read, write….).

### Get Started with SQL {#get-started-with-sql}

SQL is the language you use to interact with a database. Everytime you send an SQL query, the database will return the data in the shape you asked. There are different flavors of SQL, as well as alternatives to the language (e.g. NoSQL). However, if you are working on a beginner project, knowing basic SQL is very useful if you wish to have a database.
