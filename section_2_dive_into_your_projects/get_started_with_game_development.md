## Get Started with Game Development {#get-started-with-game-development}

Making games from scratch is hard. For example, simply implementing the physics behind a game takes a lot of work. Thankfully, there are game engines that do a lot of the work for us. There are three popular game engines: GameMaker, Unity and Unreal Engine.

### GameMaker {#gamemaker}

GameMaker is by far the simplest and most beginner friendly game engine that we have on the list. While it only supports 2d games it has very good appeal to new game developers. It is very easy to pick up and almost anything you find on the internet can be used as graphics assets. The built in language which is based on Java has very good documentation and amazing built in functions.

If this is your first time developing a game then GameMaker is recommended. To get started take a look at the flowing [link](https://www.yoyogames.com/learn)

### Unity {#unity}

Unity is one of, if not the most popular game engine out there. It supports 2d and 3d games and comes with an impressive amount of free assets. While unity does not look nearly as good as Unreal it is much easier to run on laptop computers and is a great choice for small nifty little games.

Learn to create games with Unity through the Roll-a-ball tutorial. This tutorial will teach you the basics of C\#, game physics and Unity tools [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial).

### Unreal Engine 4 {#unreal-engine-4}

As mentioned above, Unreal is graphically superior to Unity however it is much more resource intensive. Unreal also offers a block diagram based coding approach and is superior for making more or less mainstream games. We recommend it to slightly more experienced game devs who are looking for a graphically stunning product.
