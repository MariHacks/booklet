# Implement Cooler Stuff! {#section-3-implement-cooler-stuff}

Have you guys ever seen a male to male usb type A cable? A simple cable that allows you to plug one computer into another. Little did you know, but that's how computers teach each other!! \(In reality plugging one computers USB into another will only generate a whole plethora of problems and can even fry the motherboard if not properly protected\).

In reality, machine learning is the idea that a machine/algorithm can get better every time it is run by learning something either from the user or just a data set.

We also have a section on Wolfram\|One!
